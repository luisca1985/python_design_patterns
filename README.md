# Python Design Pattern
## Factory Method
Factory Method is a Creational Design Pattern that allows an interface or a class to create an object, but lets subclasses decide which class or object to instantiate. Using the Factory method, we have the best ways to create an object. Here, objects are created without exposing the logic to the client, and for creating the new type of object, the client uses the same common interface.

## Abstract Factory Method
Abstract Factory Method is a Creational Design pattern that allows you to produce the families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes. Using the abstract factory method, we have the easiest ways to produce a similar type of many objects.

It provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories. Basically, here we try to abstract the creation of the objects depending on the logic, business, platform choice, etc.
